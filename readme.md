Install and notes
=================

*install.sh* setup the symbolic links, download **vundle** and install the
plugins defined in the *vimrc* file.
Inside *vimrc* you will find my plugins list and the config files to source.
*basic.vimrc* handle vim basic config, keybindings, syntax, etc...
*plugins.vimrc* handle the plugin specific configuration.

Plugins
=======

Look at ./vimrc to check the author's repo

Core:

 - **Vundle**, manage and install plugins from your vimrc. Handle install and updates via git.
 - **Vim-Fugitive**, awesome git wrapper. Brings most of git command and github-like index navigation into vim.
 - **Ctrl-P**, navigate and open you mru, files and buffers.
 - **Lusty-explorer**, browse your file by path.

Edit:

 - **vim-expand-region**
 - **nercommender**

Look and feel:

 - **vim-airline**
 - **vim-colors-solarized**
 - **tabline**
 - **vim-startify**

I am still looking for:
 - Non agressive autocompletion.
